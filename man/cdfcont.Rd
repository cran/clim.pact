 }
\value{a list object containing two character vectors: \code{vars} and
  \code{dims} holding the names of the variables and
  dimensions. \code{dims} gives the dimensions for each of the variable,
  and may contain several names within the same string, separated by a
  comma, eg. "LONS","LATS",and "LATS, LONS" (\code{strsplit("TIME, LATS,
  LONS",", ")} can be used to split up these variables into seperate names)}
