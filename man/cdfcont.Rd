\title{netCDF names and dimensions.}
\description{Obtains the variable names and dimension names from a
  netCDF file. This routine provides some of the information returned by
  \code{\link[netCDF]{names.netCDF}}, however this function does not depend on
  the \code{netCDF} package. If it doesn't work, make sure to set the
  path to include the location of \code{ncdump} and \code{ncgen} (two
  netCDF executables, usually under a netcdf direcory). Alternatively,
  set the \code{path}.}
\usage{cdfcont(filename,path="")}
\arguments{
    \item{filename}{name of netCDF file.}
    \item{path}{Path to the location where \code{ncdump} and \code{ncgen} are located.}
 }
\value{a list object containing two character vectors: \code{vars} and
  \code{dims} holding the names of the variables and
  dimensions. \code{dims} gives the dimensions for each of the variable,
  and may contain several names within the same string, separated by a
  comma, eg. "LONS","LATS",and "LATS, LONS" (\code{strsplit("TIME, LATS,
  LONS",", ")} can be used to split up these variables into seperate
  names).
  'time.origin' returns the time\_origin, 'add.offset' gives the 'add\_offset'
  attribute, and 'scale.factor' gives the scale\_factor.}
